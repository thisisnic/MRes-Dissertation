# MRes Applied Social Statistics Dissertation

## Multilevel Modelling of Political Party Preference

### Summary

The analyses presented in this dissertation aimed to explore the nature of social class related voting, and also to examine regional differences in political party preference. It was found that class-related voting was significant when measured using individuals' self-reported social class, but not their earnings, indicating that its roots may lie in social identity rather than socio-economic status.
